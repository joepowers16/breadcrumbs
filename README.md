Why would you find breadcrumbs useful?
================
2019-12-20

I hate being unable to find code and data in old data projects. The goal
for the `breadcrumbs` package is to provide a routine structure to the
subdirectories in your R projects so that you and your collaborators can
readily store code and data in appropriate folders, and coordinate that
code and data with Makefiles.

To get started using `breadcrumbs`  
1\. open a new or existing R project  
2\. Load the breadcrumbs package `library(breadcrumbs)`  
2\. Execute the `create_project_directories()` function in your console

You will now see a standard set of project subdirectories appear in your
project directory, and breadcrumbs is filled with functions to support
the use of those subdirectories. For instance, I have found it useful to
save my filepaths to commonly used subdirectories in a dedicated script
called “file\_paths.R”. The function `source_file_paths()` will execute
this script, and I include this function at the top of all my other
scripts and Rmd files. `create_project_directories()` has also added a
Makefile to your project’s home directory. This Makefile can be used to
make your entire project reproducible from raw data to finished reports.
For more details on how to use Makefiles see the comment appendix in the
Makefile generated by breadcrumbs.

### Other useful functions

In addition to directory structure, `breadcrumbs` includes a number of
functions I find useful at the exploratory stage of data projects. For
instance `wrap()` will control the width of long ggplot titles and
facilitate your writing accurate and informative titles on all your EDA
plots without fussing around trying to find the right places to manually
insert line breaks.

``` r
library(breadcrumbs)
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    labs(title = wrap("The wrap function frees me up to write long and informative titles on my plots without having to troubleshoot the placement of linebreaks. This is useful since I often forget what I once found useful about a plot.", 80)) + 
    theme_minimal()
```

Another useful function is `clean_names()`. I use `clean_names()` the
first time I import raw data to remove capital letters and illegal
characters.

``` r
file_nyc_data <- 
    "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/kku6-nxdu/rows.csv"

# Reading data without clean_names()
read_csv(file_nyc_data) %>% select(1:4)
```
